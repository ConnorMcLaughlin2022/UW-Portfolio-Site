# UW-Portfolio-Site : README :

## Description

  This webpage was created as a space to showcase work projects and give links to contact information. I built a navigation bar in the header that will navigate to the desired section when selected as well as a personal picture added in the upper left inside my hero-image. Included in the body is an "about me" section and a "works" section. The "about me section has ample space where a personal bio can be added at a later date. The "My Work' section has 5 boxes, the first and largest is an active link to my project "Accibility Refactor", with the following four boxes can have links added in as more projects conclude. Lastly the footer section, labeled "Contact Me", contains my phone number, e-mail address, github account, twitter and spotify. All sections are formatted to be responsive and adapt to the users viewport.
